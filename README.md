# The Birthday Problem

## Introduction:
In probability theory, the birthday problem concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people,
some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when
the number of people reaches 366 (since there are 365 possible birthdays, excluding February 29th). It would
seem that we would need 183 people (half of 365) to reach a 50% probability. However, 99% probability is
reached with just 57 people and 50% probability with just 23 people. These conclusions are based on the
assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.

## Learning Outcomes:

After completing this assignment, you will have experience with:
1. Using structured data to hold a whole collection of data values.
2. Designing a solution to a larger problem and choosing the best data structure for that design.
3. Performing a simulation using randomly generated data.
4. Creating a cumulative sum loop to count things.

## Resources:
   Please download the supplied zip file available with this specification. Extract the files onto your computer. The
   extracted files contain an Android Studio project. Start Android Studio and open the project as demonstrated in
   an earlier module. All your work for this assignment will be in the file Logic.java. Open this file in the IDE
   and look for the comment:
   // TODO -- add your code here
   As you do your work, be sure to place all your code in the Logic class.
   This comment is located inside the calculate() method. The calculate() method takes in two
   parameters: the size of the group of people, and the count of the number of simulations to run. The method
   returns a value of type double that represents the percent of the simulations that had two people with the same
   birthday. If/when you add helper methods, be sure to place them in the Logic class after the calculate()
   method.

## Tasks:
   You are to write a program which will simulate the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some
   pair of them will have the same birthday. The code provided to you will get the value of n, the size of the group
   of people, and for the number of simulations to be run. For a single simulation, your program should generate a
   random birthday for each person in the group of n people and determine whether or not there are two birthdays
   that hit the same day. This simulation should be repeated the desired number of times, keeping track of the
   number of simulations for which there were two birthdays on the same day. Once all simulations have been
   completed, you are to compute the percentage of runs that had two birthdays on the same day and return that
   value to the caller.
   Additional details for this simulation:
1. To simplify the problem, we make the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally
   likely for a birthday. We will only consider 365 days in a year.
2. When generating a random birthday for a person, generate a random integer in the range 0-364, each
   number will represent an individual day in a year (0 for January 1st, and 364 for December 31st). We will
   use zero-based numbers to match array indexing.
3. When performing a single simulation, remember you only need to find one pair of matching birthdays to
   make the simulation count. That is, as soon as you determine that two people have the same birthday you
   can stop the current simulation and start the next simulation. You should avoid generating all birthdays
   when it is not necessary.
4. To ensure that everyone’s program behaves the same (so that we can auto-grade everyone’s submission),
   you will need to create a new Random object for each simulation run, and you will need to seed the
   Random object with the number of the run you are simulating (the first simulation run will use the integer 1
   as the seed, the second run will use 2 as the seed, etc.). You need to create a new Random object per
   simulation run, not per random number needed [do not use the Math.random() method in this program].
5. During one simulation, you will need to keep track of the days which correspond to someone’s birthday, or
   alternatively keep track of the number of birthdays that occur on any given day. There are several structures
   that we studied in this module of the MOOC that could be used to easily solve this problem. You are free to
   pick the structure of your choice. Note that the goal is to quickly and easily determine if two birthdays land
   on the same date.
6. When returning the final result, return the percentage in the range 0.0 – 100.0. Do not attempt to round the
   result to a certain number of decimal digits.
7. Additional performance requirement: There are many ways to correctly solve this problem; some are good,
   and some are poor. We want you to take the time to think of a good solution, not necessarily the first
   solution that comes to your mind. To enforce this, we test the efficiency of your solution. If your solution
   times out or fails the efficiency test, come up with a different solution that does not require nested loops for
   a single simulation run. This can be accomplished by using different containers covered in this module of
   the course or by using arrays or ArrayLists in different ways. There are many different efficient solution
   strategies for this problem. You just need to come up with one that makes sense to you.
8. Remember to use good program structure. Defining many small, specialized helper methods will help you
   manage the complexity and make this program easier to write.
   Source code aesthetics (commenting, indentation, spacing, identifier names): You should properly indent your
   code. No line of your code should be over 100 characters long (even better is limiting lines to 80 characters).
   You should use a consistent programming style. This should include the following.
   • Meaningful variable & method names
   • Consistent indenting
   • Use of "white-space" and blank lines to make the code more readable
   • Use of comments to explain pieces of tricky code
   • Comment headers on all methods that explain what the method computes and any pre- or postconditions

### Example:
   Given a group of 20 people and performing 10,000 simulation runs, your program should report that 41.24% of
   the time there were two people that shared the same birthday.
